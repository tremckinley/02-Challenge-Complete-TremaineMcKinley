                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I am a technical problem-solver and self-teaching web developer. I am most passionate about creating
                    innovative solutions that empower communities. With a background in non-profit operations, software
                    administration, IT support, and international business, I thrive at the intersection of technology
                    and civic engagement.</p>
                <p>Currently, I am helping shape the future of Memphis government services as a Business Services
                    Analyst for the Shelby County Division of Planning and Development. My work focuses on configuring
                    and enhancing SaaS platforms to streamline processes, improve accessibility, and drive meaningful
                    change for internal and external customers. No day is the same and I approach every challenge with
                    curiosity, determination, and a diverse toolkit. Previously, I was a Director of Finance &
                    Technology for a local charter school. Beyond my professional roles, I am a lifelong learner with
                    experience living and working abroad.</p>
                <p>I am consistently pursuing personal projects that combine creativity and technical expertise to
                    advance my personal and professional dreams. You can usually find me completing a course, networking
                    with smarter people, or developing something just because I think it will be cool. Whether I am
                    troubleshooting code, improving user experiences, or building tools to make civic tech more
                    inclusive, I am committed to leaving things better than I found them.</p>
